# S-Plus-Mobile-Network-

An nsâ€“3-based system level simulation test setup, which primarily consists of point to point helper, network, applications, mobility and core modules. Besides this, OFSwitch13 module [23] has been implemented in ns-3 simulator that enable support for OpenFlow protocol version 1.3. we extended the NS3 environment to implement instantiation of multiple DPEs and modified the currently deployed X2-based handover procedure of the NS3 to support relocation of DPE during the MUs handover. It implements the messages exchange between the different network functions for inter-system handover and DPE relocation enforcing the policies and the behaviour described in section 5.1 and 5.2. The source code of implemented modules is available via [24]. The logical network topology of the evaluation scenario is shown in Figure 4. The simulation starts with a MU initially attached to the PDN service 1 via 3GPP compliant access network. Moving out of S+ eNB coverage area the MU discovers and switches to non- 3GPP compliant access connection. We set the parameters for simulation in which data packets are set to 1000 units and simulation interval is 10ms. For each handover case, we measured the preparation, interruption and completion time. Figures 8a and 8b depicts the measured handover execution time,
